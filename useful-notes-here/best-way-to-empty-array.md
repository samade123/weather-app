# Emptying an array in JavaScript

To empty an array in JavaScript, there are several ways to accomplish this task:

1. Assigning an empty array to the variable:

```javascript
 arr = [];
```
2. Using the splice() method to remove all elements from the array:

```javascript
arr.splice(0, arr.length);
```
3. Using the length property to set the length of the array to 0:

```javascript
arr.length = 0;
```
All three methods have their pros and cons, so the best way to empty an array in JavaScript depends on the specific use case.


## Pros and cons of each method

### Assigning an empty array to the variable
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Creates a new array and assigns it to the variable, which can be problematic if there are other references to the original array.

### Using the splice() method
- Modifies the existing array in place by removing all elements from index 0 to the end of the array.
- More verbose and can be slower than the other methods for large arrays.
- May still leave behind some "holes" in the array.
Using the length property
- Modifies the existing array in place by setting the length property to 0.
- Concise and generally faster than the splice() method.
- Can cause problems if there are other references to the original array.
- May leave behind some "holes" in the array.

## Choosing the best method

The best way to empty an array in JavaScript depends on the specific use case and context. If reducing memory usage is a top priority and there is only one reference to the array, using the `arr.length = 0` method to empty the array would be the best choice. If you need to keep the original array reference and want to ensure that there are no "holes" left in the array, using the splice() method may be a better choice. Finally, if simplicity and readability are more important than performance or memory usage, assigning an empty array to the variable might be the way to go.

# Specific use case
I personally only had one reference to the array and wanted to reduce memory usage as much as possible. Based on that, i used the arr.length = 0 method.
